 * We have used only Bootstrap framework
 
**We used following libraries**
* intro.js 
* slick-nav.js 
* nice-select.js 
* slick
* bootstrap
* bootstrap material design
* flat-icon
* animate.css
* font-awesome
* we have taken most of the images from google images and rendered them using photoshop for the need of our website

**How our Website Satisfies the Theme (Furniture and Appliances)**
  We have madea modern responsive website that not only makes your shopping a pleasant feeling but also makes you fall in love with the website with how easy and fast it is.
We have tried to cover all types of furnitures and appliances in our website and have given a detailed model of the prcing. Also, we have made a logo and given a company name to make it sound more like a brand.


**What Problems Did you faced**
* The foremost challenge was using git efficiently as we initally often ran into merge conflicts and had to rewrite whole files in github itself to resolve it.
* To make the header sticky after we scroll and make it more efficient to use. 
* Deciding upon the color scheme, the structure and everything else to match the theme. (we wanted to go for a wooden based theme as that suited the theme of our website better).
* Making the cards in the contact menu
* Adding rotation animation,finding and rendrering the images for it.
* How to write a good Readme

**How did we overcome these and what new things we learnt**
* We decided to break the pages in components and each one us started working on different components. In the end, when most of the work was done, we compiled it in index.html and style.css. For the reference of organisers, we have left those old files in git repo as well.
* We created a jQuery function to add and remove class dynamically depending upon the scroll value, similarly for active class.
* We searched complimentng pastel colors that work with each other and the theme.
* We used clippath animation, to create the card in contact menu, which was something new for us.
* We had to first find suitable images to combine and create the images and had to figure out the center of the image so that rotation happens on the center of the image.
* We also learnt lots of new libraries intro.js, alan-voice command, bootstrap-md and many more small things.

**Special Features**
  * **Alan Voice Button**
    * say Hey|Hello|Whats up|Greetings|Good Morning|Good Evening|Namaste|Namaskar to your own personal assistant.
    * Feel free to ask it what our website do, ask for a suggestion or how the website works.
  * **Preloader**
  * **Counters**

  * **Contact Cards**
    * contact cards that will make you fall in love with it.
  * **Rotating Image on Top of Image**
